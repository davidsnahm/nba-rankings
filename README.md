##**NBA Rankings from 1964-2015**
This is an R Shiny app that allows users to interactively see how different NBA teams have done. The rankings are all standardized to a 30 team league (so finishing 1st in 1964 does not count as much as finishing 1st in 2015 because there were fewer teams). The user can interactively select the team and choose the timespan to be visualized. You can follow **[this link](https://davidsnahm.shinyapps.io/nba_rankings)** to use the app.
